Some shells, such as Bash have functionality allowing users to circumvent this. [5] Traditionally, globs do not match hidden files in the form of Unix dotfiles ; to match them the pattern must explicitly start with .. For example, * matches all visible files while .* matches all hidden files. Globs do not include syntax for the Kleene star which allows multiple repetitions of the preceding part of the expression; Wildcard in SQL[ edit ] The SQL LIKE operator has an equivalent to ? and * but not [\u2026]. Common wildcard SQL wildcard Description ? _ matches any single character * % matches any number of any characters including none Regular expression (regex or regexp): A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp ; [1] also referred to as rational expression [2] [3] ) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern . The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language . Regular expressions are used in search engines , search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors , in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis . Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries , as it has uses in many situations. \\<\\< linux command line and shell scripting bible>>The biggest problem with using regular expressions is that there isn't just one set of them. Several different applications use different types of regular expressions in the Linux environment. A regular expression is implemented using a regular expression engine. The Linux world has two popular regular expression engines: The POSIX Basic Regular Expression (BRE) engine -->(grep) The POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ERE) engine --->(egrep) These special characters are recognized by regular expressions: .*[]^${}+?|() If you want to use one of the special characters as a text character, you need to escape it using . . (dot) - a single character. the dot matches any character except a newline ? - the preceding character matches 0 or 1 times only. * - the preceding character matches 0 or more times. + - the preceding character matches 1 or more times. {n} - the preceding character matches exactly n times. {n,m} - the preceding character matches at least n times and not more than m times. [agd] - the character is one of those included within the square brackets. [^agd] - the character is not one of those included within the square brackets. [c-f] - the dash within the square brackets operates as a range. In this case it means either the letters c, d, e or f. () - allows us to group several characters to behave as one. | (pipe symbol) - the logical OR operation. ^ - matches the beginning of the line. $ - matches the end of the line. [ Regex Usage in Text editors sed # The sed editor is called a stream editor , as opposed to a normal interactive text editor like vim.A stream editor edits a stream of data based on a set of rules you supply ahead of time, before the editor processes the data. Sed 's/dog/cat/' data.txt # s substitutes dog with cat in the contents of data.txt, and then stream to stdout. The source data is not changed. sed -e 's/brown/green/; s/dog/cat/' data1.txt ## -e multiple commands, substitutes brown with green, dog with cat in the contents of data.txt, and then stream to stdout. sed -e ' # the first single quotation mark open interactive input > s/brown/green/ > s/fox/elephant/ > s/dog/cat/' data1.txt gawk #works with POSIX ERE patterns gawk '{print $n}' data.txt # print out the nth world in each line of data.txt gawk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd # show the second word separated by : in each line of the passwd file echo \"my name is eric\" | gawk '{$4=\"donghui Zhai\"; print $0}' # replace the 4th world with donghui zhai and then print out the whole sentence to the stdout. $ gawk 'BEGIN {print \"The data3 File Contents:\"} # interactive input mode , first command show the message in the beginning of the file > {print $0} # second command > END {print \"End of File\"}' data3.txt # last command, show the message at the end of the file grep [options] pattern [files]# searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p ( g lobally search a r egular e xpression and p rint), which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines.

Any one character * .* Any zero/more chars Globs attempt to match the entire string (for example, S*.DOC matches S.DOC and SA.DOC, but not POST.DOC or SURREY.DOCKS), whereas, depending on implementation details, regular expressions may match a substring. In regular expressions , the period (., also called \"dot\") is the wildcard pattern which matches any single character. Combined with the asterisk operator .* it will match any number of any characters.In this case, the asterisk is also known as the Kleene star .

The term macro processor means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions. metacharacter A character that, when unquoted, separates words. A metacharacter is a space, tab, newline, or one of the following characters: '|', '&', ';', '(', ')', '\\<', or '>'. control operator A token that performs a control function. It is a newline or one of the following: '||', '&&', '&', ';', ';;', ';&', ';;&', '|', '|&', '(', or ')'. \uff01# history expansion character. History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is '!' by default The following is a brief description of the shell's operation when it reads and executes a command. Basically, the shell does the following: Reads its input from a file (see Shell Scripts ), from a string supplied as an argument to the -c invocation option (see Invoking Bash ), or from the user's terminal. Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules described in Quoting . These tokens are separated by metacharacters. Alias expansion is performed by this step (see Aliases ). Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands (see Shell Commands ). Performs the various shell expansions (see Shell Expansions ), breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames (see Filename Expansion ) and commands and arguments. Performs any necessary redirections (see Redirections ) and removes the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list. Executes the command (see Executing Commands ). Optionally waits for the command to complete and collects its exit status (see Exit Status ). 3.1.2 Quoting Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion. Each of the shell metacharacters (see Definitions ) has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself. \\ #escape character \u8f6c\u4e49\u5b57\u7b26 It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of newline. If a \\newline pair appears, and the backslash itself is not quoted, the \\newline is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored). ' #single quote \u5355\u5f15\u53f7 Enclosing characters in single quotes (''') preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash. The special parameters '*' and '@' have special meaning when in double quotes (see Shell Parameter Expansion ). \" # double quote \u53cc\u5f15\u53f7 Enclosing characters in double quotes ('\"') preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of '$', '`', '\\', and, when history expansion is enabled, '!'. Echo \"starting program at $(date)\" # date commond will be executed 1.

(So, no spaces on either side of the = sign.) When we refer to a variable, we must place a dollar sign ( $ ) before the variable name. Run shell script A script must have the execute permission before we may run it (even if we are the owner of the file). For safety reasons, you don't have execute permission by default so you have to add it. A good command to run to ensure your script is set up right is chmod 755 \\<script>. When we run a script, there are several variables that get set automatically for us. Here are some of them: $ cat myscript !/bin/bash echo \"First arg: $1\" echo \"Second arg: $2\" $ ./myscript hello world First arg: hello Second arg: world $0 - The name of the script. $1 - $9 - Any command line arguments given to the script. $1 is the first argument, $2 the second and so on. $# - How many command line arguments were given to the script. $* - All of the command line arguments. * * * * command to execute # Cron stands for Command Run ON. It is a mechanism that allows you to tell the system to run certain commands at certain times. * * * * * /bin/myscript.sh # Execute myscript.sh every minute. 30 3 * * 4 /bin/myscript.sh # Execute myscript.sh every Thursday at 3:30am. crontab -l # To view a list of what tasks you currently have scheduled you may run the following command: crontab -e # To edit your scheduled tasks, run the following command.

Piping and redirection Piping and redirection is the means by which we may connect these streams between programs and files to direct data in interesting and useful ways. Every program we run on the command line automatically has three data streams connected to it. STDIN (0) - Standard input (data fed into the program) STDOUT (1) - Standard output (data printed by the program, defaults to the terminal) STDERR (2) - Standard error (for error messages, also defaults to the terminal l # pipe output to a new command ls | head -3 #a mechanism for sending data from one program to another. It's called piping and the operator we use is ( | ). What this operator does is feed the output from the program on the left as input to the program on the right. ls | head -3 | tail -1 ls -l /etc | tail -n +2 | sort #we are sorting the listing of a directory so that all the directories are listed first. ls -l /etc | less #feed the output of a program into the program less so that we can view it easier. ls -l ~ | grep '^.....w' #Identify all files in your home directory which the group has write permission for. ls -l /projects/ghosttrail | tail -n +2 | sed 's/\\s\\s*/ /g' | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c #Create a listing of every user which owns a file in a given directory as well as how many files and directories they own. Only some commands(touch) receive inputs from standard input(etc. pipe), other commands (rm) don't. > #output re-direction, overwrite. Save output to a file. nohup ./script_stingray.sh >nohup_stingray.out ls > myoutput #The greater than operator ( > ) indicates to the command line that we wish the programs output (or whatever it sends to STDOUT) to be saved in a file instead of printed to the screen. If we redirect to a file which does not exist, it will be created automatically for us. If we save into a file which already exists, however, then it's contents will be cleared, then the new output saved to it >> # Append output to a file. nohup ./script_stingray.sh >> nohup_stingray.out ls >> myoutput #We can instead get the new data to be appended to the file by using the double greater than operator ( >> ). \\< #Read input from a file parallel --gnu -j 8 ./run_stingray.sh \\<userlist.txt wc -l \\< myoutput # print out the line numbers in myoutput. If we use the less than operator ( \\< ) then we can send data the other way. We will read data from the file and feed it into the program via it's STDIN stream. whenever we use redirection or piping, the data is sent anonymously. So in the above example, wc recieved some content to process, but it has no knowledge of where it came from so it may not print this information. wc -l \\< barry.txt > myoutput # output the line numbers of file barry.txt into myoutput file 4. 2> # Redirect error messages.Send the output from one program as input to another program. ls -l video.mpg blah.foo 2> errors.txt #STDERR is stream number 2 and we may use these numbers to identify the streams. If we place a number before the > operator then it will redirect that stream (if we don't use a number, like we have been doing so far, then it defaults to stream 1). ls -l video.mpg blah.foo > myoutput 2>&1 #save both normal output and error messages into a single file. This can be done by redirecting the STDERR stream to the STDOUT stream and redirecting STDOUT to a file. We redirect to a file first then redirect the error stream. We identify the redirection to a stream by placing an & in front of the stream number (otherwise it would redirect to a file called 1).

A terminal multiplexer can run a command in a separate session, detached from the current terminal, which means that if the current session ends, the detached session and its associated processes keeps running. One can then reattach to the session later on.Its function is quite similiar to screen. tmux # create a session that you can detach and re-attach later on tmux new tmux new -s [session-name] #create a new session show created sessions Ctrl-b s # Tmux ls Tmux a # connect to the first available session Tmux a -t \\<session-name> #attach to a specific session Tmux detach #detach from a session Ctrl-b d #detach from a session Ctrl-b & #kill the current session Tmux kill-session -t \\<session-name> #killing a session 4.Nohup nohup is a POSIX command to ignore the HUP (hangup) signal.

Everything is a File. Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / ); /home/zhai65/pyth Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash. ~/python; ./textfile; ../work; Linux is an Extensionless System. The dot has no special meaning as a separator, and extensions can be any length. But in practice, users can still use extension to indicate the file types for themselves, such as .txt, .c(C program source file), .a(archive file/library), .tar(tar archive), .gz/.tgz Hidden files/directories : Filenames that begin with a period are treated specially by the shell: wildcards won't match them unless you include the period (like .*). The ls command, which lists your files, ignores files whose names begin with a period unless you give it a special option (ls -a ) 1. File access permission Linux permissions dictate 3 things you may do with a file, read, write and execute. They are referred to in Linux by a single letter each. r read - you may view the contents of the file. w write - you may change the contents of the file. x execute - you may execute or run the file if it is a program or script. For the file, each corresponding permission allows following actions. The read (r) permission allows owner to examine contents of the file. The write (w) permission allows owner to modify the file. The execute (x) permission allows owner to run the file as a command. For the directory, each corresponding permission allows following actions. The read (r) permission allows owner to list contents of the directory. The write (w) permission allows owner to add or remove files in the directory. The execute (x) permission allows owner to access files in the directory. For every file we define 3 sets of people for whom we may specify permissions. owner - a single person who owns the file. (typically the person who created the file but ownership may be granted to some one else by certain users) group - every file belongs to a single group. others - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner. drwxrwxr-x 4 zhai65 zhai65 4.0K Aug 29 21:18 ASSIST_project -rw-r--r-- 1 zhai65 zhai65 0 Aug 29 20:05 typescript In the above example the first 10 characters of the output are what we look at to identify permissions. The first character identifies the file type. If it is a dash ( - ) then it is a normal file. If it is a d then it is a directory. The following 3 characters represent the permissions for the owner. A letter represents the presence of a permission and a dash ( - ) represents the absence of a permission. In this example the owner has all permissions (read, write and execute). The following 3 characters represent the permissions for the group. In this example the group has the ability to read but not write or execute. Note that the order of permissions is always read, then write then execute. Finally the last 3 characters represent the permissions for others (or everyone else). In this example they have the execute permission and nothing else. Number of hard links to the file Name of the user who owns the file Name of the group which the file belongs to Size of the file in characters (bytes) Date and time of the file (mtime) Name of the file Set user ID, set group ID, sticky bit In addition to the basic permissions discussed above, there are also three bits of information defined for files in Linux: http://www.zzee.com/solutions/linux-permissions.shtml https://evolt.org/node/263 SUID or setuid: change user ID on execution . If setuid bit is set, when the file will be executed by a user, the process will have the same rights as the owner of the file being executed. SGID or setgid: change group ID on execution . Same as above, but inherits rights of the group of the owner of the file on execution. For directories it also may mean that when a new file is created in the directory it will inherit the group of the directory (and not of the user who created the file). Sticky bit . It was used to trigger process to \"stick\" in memory after it is finished, now this usage is obsolete. Currently its use is system dependant and it is mostly used to suppress deletion of the files that belong to other users in the folder where you have \"write\" access to.

See Cut/copy and paste using visual selection for the main article. Cut and paste: Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting. Press v to select characters, or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks (use Ctrl-q if Ctrl-v is mapped to paste). Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut. Press d to cut (or y to copy). Move to where you would like to paste. Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after. Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d: d stands for delete in Vim, which in other editors is usually called cut y stands for yank in Vim, which in other editors is usually called copy Nano # a simple editor vim \\<file> # enhanced version of vi, Vi IMproved. a command line text editor.

(eg d5w means delete 5 words) dd #delete the line at the current cursor postion p # past the deleted text into current cursor position u # Undo the last action (you may keep pressing u to keep undoing) U (Note: capital) - Undo all changes to the current line v # select the text you want to copy, then move the cursor to where you what to edit, then press either x or y to cut or copy. y # paste the text into the current position Arrow keys - move the cursor around j, k, h, l - move the cursor down, up, left and right (similar to the arrow keys) ^ (caret ) - move cursor to beginning of current line $ - move cursor to end of the current line G - move to the last line nG - move to the nth line (eg 5G moves to 5th line) w - move to the beginning of the next word nw - move forward n word (eg 2w moves two words forwards) b - move to the beginning of the previous word nb - move back n word { - move backward one paragraph } - move forward one paragraph Command mode # u when enter any of these three signs :, /, ? under normal mode, it will enter command mode. ZZ (Note: capitals) - Save and exit : # open interactive command line input :q! - discard all changes, since the last save, and exit :w - save file but don't exit :wq - again, save and exit :set nu # it will enable line numbers Any command beginning with a colon ( : ) requires you to hit \\<enter> to complete the command. Several of them also allow us to precede them with a number to move that many times. Editorial mode # when type i, o or a under normal mode, it will switch to edit mode Most commands within vi are executed as soon as you press a sequence of keys.

Exascience tutorial Linux computer servers (imec policy) There are several compute servers within imec. Make sure you read read this to find the right one Which Linux Compute Servers should I use? In general, you should only use the servers of your own division or group. There is however no publicly available list that specifies which servers belong to which groups. Within STS, over 100 servers are grouped in a batch-processing cluster. You can find more information about this here . If you're not sure on which server to use, contact the Linux key-users within your division or group: STS : Geoffrey Pourtois, Jeroen Van de Kerkhove ICLINK : Stat Verhaege SE : Eddy De Greef Imec unixwiki: Tutorial for imec linux server Login: Using Putty for ssh connections, download and install Putty Via putty, Host name: login01 with port:22 Run in the console, establish the connection using imec pc credentials after login to imex linux server, you can use the following command to connect with exascience cluster ssh zhai65@lab.exascience.com -p 22 Tutorial for exascience cluster https://wiki.exascience.org/ Login basics : Download and install openVPN (on windows): search and download from the internet Copy your cluster credentials to its config folder Start as administrator Only internet explorer is working. https://wiki.exascience.org/ Ssh-keygen Login: Using Putty for ssh connections, download and install Putty Winscp for transferring Via putty, Host name: wiki.exascience.org with port:22 /Run in the console, establish the connection Via bash console/git console >ssh zhai65@lynx.exascience.org -p 22 / first, login through head node > ssh zhai65@lab.exascience.com -p 22 / it also works fileZilla: login to a lynx node: host: ly-2-05.exascience.org #specify a node protocol: STFP \u2013 SSH File Transfer Protocol logon Type: Normal user: zhai Password: Foss: free and open source software Intel: may run faster Versions may be chosen Cygwin ssh zhai65@lynx.exascience.org password Command: man \\<module> #look for the manual page for usage of the command isub \u2013 help # a script written by Minnesota Supercomputing Institute isub #-reserves whatver node is available in whatever node/assign resources to you isub -p fat/lynx/mic/wildcat # second, choose one server pool from these four, allocate a node to your task. #the hosts are organized in several pools, which you can select for each isub invocation through a -p \\<pool> argument.

You can: Choose your favorite GNU/Linux distributions from the Microsoft Store . Run common command-line tools such as grep, sed, awk, or other ELF-64 binaries. Run Bash shell scripts and GNU/Linux command-line applications including: Tools: vim, emacs, tmux Languages: NodeJS , Javascript, Python , Ruby, C/C++, C# & F#, Rust, Go, etc. Services: SSHD, MySQL , Apache, lighttpd, MongoDB , PostgreSQL . Install additional software using your own GNU/Linux distribution package manager. Invoke Windows applications using a Unix-like command-line shell. Invoke GNU/Linux applications on Windows. Windows interoperability with Linux Files and Home Directory across OS file systems https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions 6/26/2021 We recommend against working across operating systems with your files, unless you have a specific reason for doing so. For the fastest performance speed, store your files in the WSL file system if you are working in a Linux command line (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc). If you're working in a Windows command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt), store your files in the Windows file system. For example, when storing your WSL project files: Use the Linux file system root directory: \\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\<user name>\\Project Not the Windows file system root directory: C:\\Users\\<user name>\\Project All currently running distributions (wsl -l) are accessible via network connection. To get there run a command [WIN+R] (keyboard shortcut) or type in File Explorer address bar \\wsl$ to find respective distribution names and access their root file systems. An important consideration: when you enable WSL and install a Linux distribution, you are installing a new file system, separated from the Windows NTFS C:\\ drive on your machine. In Linux, drives are not given letters. They are given mount points. The root of your file system / is the mount point of your root partition, or folder, in the case of WSL. Not everything under / is the same drive. For example, on my laptop, I've installed two version of Ubuntu (20.04 and 18.04), as well as Debian. If I open those distributions, select the home directory with the command cd ~, and then enter the command explorer.exe ., Windows File Explorer will open and show me the directory path for that distribution. Linux distro Windows Path to access home folder Ubuntu 20.04 \\wsl$\\Ubuntu-20.04\\home\\username --- --- Ubuntu 18.04 \\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\username Debian \\wsl$\\Debian\\home\\username Windows PowerShell C:\\Users\\username Tip If you are seeking to access the Windows file directory from your WSL distribution command line, instead of C:\\Users\\username, the directory would be accessed using /mnt/c/Users/username , because the Linux distribution views your Windows file system as a mounted drive. you can also access your local machine's file system from within the Linux Bash shell \u2013 you'll find your local drives mounted under the /mnt folder. For example, your C: drive is mounted under /mnt/c https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/interop Saturday, June 26, 2021 Run Windows tools from Linux WSL can run Windows tools directly from the WSL command line using [tool-name].exe . For example, notepad.exe . Applications run this way have the following properties: Retain the working directory as the WSL command prompt (for the most part -- exceptions are explained below). Have the same permission rights as the WSL process. Run as the active Windows user. Appear in the Windows Task Manager as if directly executed from the CMD prompt. Windows executables run in WSL are handled similarly to native Linux executables -- piping, redirects, and even backgrounding work as expected. To run the Windows tool ipconfig.exe, use the Linux tool grep to filter the \"IPv4\" results, and use the Linux tool cut to remove the column fields, from a Linux distribution (for example, Ubuntu) enter: BashCopy ipconfig.exe | grep IPv4 | cut -d: -f2 Wimdows terminals, command line interfaces Windows Command line https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/ Cls #clear the screen Help # show the available commands \\<comand> /? # show detailed usage method for a specific command Help command # set [variable=[sting]] # display/set the environment parameters for cmd.exe set #display the current environment variable set PROGRAM_HOME=C:\\Users\\zhai65\\installed_folder #set a variable set PATH=%PATH%;%PROGRAM_HOME%\\bin # set the installed directory of a program into the path variable of the windows system Basics C: #Go to the C: drive. Similarly A: and D: etc. CD #Change directory. When you change directory, the prompt changes, showing the path of the directory you are currently in. * CD* # takes you to the top of the directory tree (typically to C:) . CD.. #moves you one level up the directory tree (i.e. up towards the root directory) CD \\<DIRECTORYNAME> #takes you to that directory.

Whether such commands are implemented (or not) depends on how an actual application program (such as an editor) is written. Not all applications follow (all of) these conventions, so if it doesn't work, it isn't compatible.

The relevant measurements are file size, and text size. I have a similar document that I use daily. currently about 3000 pages, recently up to 68MB in total size. Adding graphics can bloat the total size, and that can lead to slowdowns in performance. . One thing you can do is simplify the document. If you are pasting from many sources, like from the internet, your settings may also copy styles. That can create a lot of \"clutter\" and complexity in the document that could slow it down. Display the style pane and see how many styles you have in the document. If you see a lot of strange ones, you can start deleting them. If the styles represent formatting you are not using, or they look like normal, you can simply delete them, the formatting will revert to the NORMAL style.

As a workaround, you can save in an older file format or you can add frame formatting to your heading paragraph style. The workarounds are 1. insert a section break (New Page or Odd Page) before each chapter heading, 2. save the document in \\*.doc format, although that shouldn't be done if the document contains anything created by features that are new since Word 2003, or 3. add a frame with a fixed height to the definition of the Heading 1 style.

Speaking of this, Word provides several distinct solutions. Let's take a look to find out more details. Method 1: Use \"Paste Link\" Option Firstly, copy a range of text or the entire source document. Then put insertion pointer properly and click \"Paste\" under \"Home\" tab. Next choose \"Paste Special\" to open the same name dialog box. In the \"Paste Special\" box, select \"Paste link\". And click to select a link type, such as \"Formatted Text\" or \"Unformatted Text\". Lastly, click \"OK\". Any change made in source text should reflect in the new document if you update the link by right click and choosing \"Update Link\". Method 2: Insert an Object To begin with, click \"Insert\" tab then click \"Object\" in \"Text\" group. Next in \"Object\" box open, click \"Create from File\" tab first. Then click \"Browse\" to select a file. And check \"Link to file\" box. Finally, click \"OK\". Notice that you will insert the whole document into the new location. You can use the same way in method 1 to update the link. Method 3: Create a Master Document Linking to Its Subdocument It's also a good choice to create a master document that link to subdocument to connect the two files. We have a previous article that explains every detailed step. You can refer to this link: How to Create a Master Document that Links to Multiple Subdocuments in Your Word Method 4: Hyperlink a Bookmark from Source Document First and foremost, create a bookmark for a block of texts in the source document.

[1] It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieve organisational objectives by making the best use of knowledge. [2] An established discipline since 1991, [3] KM includes courses taught in the fields of business administration , information systems , management, library , and information science . [3] [4] Other fields may contribute to KM research, including information and media, computer science , public health and public policy . [5] Several universities offer dedicated master's degrees in knowledge management. Personal knowledge management https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management Personal knowledge management ( PKM ) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities ( Grundspenkis 2007 ) and the way in which these processes support work activities ( Wright 2005 ). It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own growth and learning ( Smedley 2009 ). It is a bottom-up approach to knowledge management (KM) ( Pollard 2008 ). Skills[ edit source ] Skills associated with personal knowledge management include: Reflection. Continuous improvement on how the individual operates. Manage learning. Manage how and when the individual learns. Information literacy . Understanding what information is important and how to find unknown information. Organizational skills. Personal librarianship . Personal categorization and taxonomies . Networking with others. Knowing what your network of people knows. Knowing who might have additional knowledge and resources to help you Researching, canvassing , paying attention , interviewing and observational \"cultural anthropology\" skills Communication skills. Perception , intuition , expression , visualization and interpretation . Creative skills. Imagination, pattern recognition , appreciation, innovation, inference. Understanding of complex adaptive systems . Collaboration skills. Coordination, synchronization , experimentation , cooperation and design . PKM has also been linked to these tools:[ citation needed ] Social bookmarking and enterprise bookmarking Knowledge logs (k-logs) Email, calendars, task managers Virtual assistants Wikis , including personal wikis and semantic wikis Other useful tools include stories and narrative inquiry , decision support systems , various kinds of node\u2013link diagram (such as argument maps , mind maps , concept maps ), and similar information visualization techniques. Individuals use these tools to capture ideas, expertise, experience, opinions or thoughts, and this \"voicing\" will encourage cognitive diversity and promote free exchanges away from a centralized policed knowledge repository.[ citation needed ] The goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and personal content management. Davies and colleagues mentioned the following as examples of software applications that have been used to build PKBs: [1] Open source Compendium (software) Haystack (MIT project) Closed source MyLifeBits NoteCards Personal Knowbase TheBrain Tinderbox (application software) User modelling or User Profile https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_modeling Information about users can be gathered in several ways. There are three main methods: Asking for specific facts while (first) interacting with the system [2] Mostly this kind of data gathering is linked with the registration process. While registering users are asked for specific facts, their likes and dislikes and their needs. Often the given answers can be altered afterwards. Learning users' preferences by observing and interpreting their interactions with the system [2] In this case users are not asked directly for their personal data and preferences, but this information is derived from their behavior while interacting with the system. The ways they choose to accomplish a tasks, the combination of things they takes interest in, these observations allow inferences about a specific user. The application dynamically learns from observing these interactions. Different machine learning algorithms may be used to accomplish this task. A hybrid approach which asks for explicit feedback and alters the user model by adaptive learning [5] This approach is a mixture of the ones above. Users have to answer specific questions and give explicit feedback. Furthermore, their interactions with the system are observed and the derived information are used to automatically adjust the user models. Methods and Tools for Managing Knowledge and Information Peronal wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki A personal wiki is wiki software that allows individual users to organize information on their desktop or mobile computing devices in a manner similar to community wikis , but without collaborative software or multiple users. Personal wiki software can be broadly divided into two categories: Multi-user applications with personal editions (such as MoinMoin or TWiki ), installed for standalone use and inaccessible to outside users, which may require additional software such as a web server , database management system and/or WAMP / LAMP bundle [1] Applications designed for single users, not dependent on a database engine or web server https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software#Personal_wiki_software Personal wiki software[ edit source ] Further information: Personal wiki ConnectedText is a commercial Windows-based personal wiki system with features including full text searches , visual link tree , customizable interface, image and file control, CSS-based page display, exports to HTML and HTML Help, and plug-ins. Journler is a free, open-source personal information manager with personal wiki features for OS X. MyInfo is a commercial, Windows-based personal information manager with wiki features. TiddlyWiki is a free, open-source personal use (single-machine) wiki based on HTML/JavaScript for any browser and OS. It supports customization and a wide range of addons. WhizFolders is a commercial Windows-based personal wiki software with rich text wiki items that support inserting links to other wiki items or external files. Zim is a free, open-source standalone wiki based on Python and GTK with a WYSIWYG editor. Hosted-only software[ edit source ] Further information: Wiki hosting service Knowledge Plaza is a knowledge management tool that provides both wiki environments for collaborative topic/project work and an enterprise bookmarking tool. Nuclino is a real-time wiki for team collaboration. Content management and social software with wiki functionality[ edit source ] Further information: Content management system and Enterprise social software Java-based[ edit source ] ConcourseConnect is a freely available J2EE application made by Concursive which brings together Corporate Social Networking , Online Community , Business directory , and Customer relationship management capabilities. Features include wiki, blog, document management , ratings, reviews, online classified advertising]]\\, and project management modules. The wiki allows both wiki markup and WYSIWYG editing. Confluence is a commercial J2EE application which combines wiki and some blog functionality. Its features include PDF page export and page refactoring, and it can be run on any application server using any RDBMS backend. IBM Connections is an Enterprise Social Software made by IBM which combines Wikis, Blogs, Files, Forums, Microblogging, Social Analytics, and document management. Jive (formerly known as Clearspace, Jive SBS and Jive Engage) is a commercial J2EE application, made by Jive Software , which combines wiki, blog and document management functionality. Jive uses WYSIWYG editing, and includes workflow management. Liferay is an open source enterprise portal project with a built-in web content management and web application framework. Core portlets offer a great number of functionalities, including Wiki (both Creole and MediaWiki syntax). Mindquarry creates a WYSIWYG wiki for each team. It is built using Apache Cocoon and thus based on Java (Mozilla Public License) Traction TeamPage is a commercial enterprise wiki also incorporating blog, project management, document management, discussion and tagging capabilities. The wiki has a draft moderation capability allowing administrators to indicate who can read published vs. draft versions, and who can publish vs. author and edit. The dynamic view architecture allows for easy organization of pages and to collect any set of pages for view, email or export. It is based on the principles of Douglas Engelbart 's On-Line System (NLS) which aggregates multiple blog/wiki spaces using a sophisticated permission and inline comment model. XWiki includes the standard wiki functionality as well as WYSIWYG editing, OpenDocument based document import/export, semantic annotations and tagging, and advanced permissions management. notetaking Comparison of note-taking software https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_note-taking_software Name Developer(s) License Platforms AllMyNotes Organizer Vladonai Software Proprietary , Freemium Microsoft Windows --- --- --- --- BasKet Note Pads KDE GPL-2.0-or-later Unix-like ( KDE ) CintaNotes Cinta Software Proprietary , Freemium Microsoft Windows ConnectedText Eduardo Mauro Proprietary , Commercial Microsoft Windows Day One Bloom Built Proprietary , Commercial macOS, iOS, Android Dropbox Paper Dropbox Proprietary , Freemium Android, IOS, web-based Evernote Evernote Corporation Proprietary , Freemium for personal use, per-seat licensing for business Android, iOS, macOS, Microsoft Windows 7/8/10, Microsoft Windows Phone, and web-based Gnote Aurimas \u010cernius GPL-3.0-or-later Linux Google Keep Google Proprietary , no-cost Android, iOS, Chrome OS, browser based Joplin laurent22 et al MIT Microsoft Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android KeyNote NF Marek Jedli\u0144ski, Tranglos Software MPL-2.0 Microsoft Windows Memonic Nektoon AG Proprietary , Freemium [Notes 1] Android (not released yet), iOS, macOS, Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/Mobile web-based Microsoft OneNote Microsoft Proprietary , Shareware / Freeware / Freemium [Notes 2] Android, macOS, iOS (iPad, iPhone), Microsoft Windows 7/8/10, Microsoft Windows Server 2008R2/2012R2/2016, Microsoft Windows Phone 8/8.1/10, web-based , mobile web MyInfo Milenix Software Proprietary , Shareware Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/10 MyNotex Massimo Nardello GPL-3.0-or-later Linux Notational Velocity Zachary Schneirov GPL-3.0-or-later macOS Notes Apple Proprietary macOS , iOS , web-based Notion Notion Labs Inc.

A zettelkasten consists of many individual notes with ideas and other short pieces of information that are taken down as they occur or are acquired. The notes are numbered hierarchically, so that new notes may be inserted at the appropriate place, and contain metadata to allow the note-taker to associate notes with each other. For example, notes may contain tags that describe key aspects of the note, and they may reference other notes. The numbering, metadata, format and structure of the notes is subject to variation depending on the specific method employed. A zettelkasten may be created and used in a digital format, sometimes using personal knowledge management software. But it can be and has long been done on paper using index cards . One researcher famous for his extensive use of the method was the sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927\u20131998). Luhmann built up a zettelkasten of some 90,000 index cards for his research, and credited it for enabling his extraordinarily prolific writing (including over 70 books and 400 scholarly articles). Outlier processor (tree structure text files) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner File formats[ edit source ] Several file formats support an outline structure natively or encourage the use/creation of outline structures. XML - XML's purpose is to aid information systems in sharing structured data HTML / XHTML - outlines relatively trivial thanks to nested markup OPML - simple XML-based format designed for outlines, but also used for syndication feedlists OML - alternative to OPML RDF - (various formats) has web-oriented node & arc graph model, a subset can be used for outline XOXO - dedicated HTML -based microformat for outlines CHM - standard Windows format for help, books, etc. Desktop outliners[ edit source ] Name Operating system Notes AllMyNotes Organizer Windows Can password-protect file access, supports skins .

This kind of metadata helps describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching. [1] Tags are generally chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system, although they may also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary . [2] :\u200a68\u200a Tagging was popularized by websites associated with Web 2.0 and is an important feature of many Web 2.0 services. [2] [3] It is now also part of other database systems , desktop applications , and operating systems . concept- and mind-mapping software https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map A concept map is a way of representing relationships between ideas , images , or words in the same way that a sentence diagram represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a circuit diagram represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel. A concept map or conceptual diagram is a diagram that depicts suggested relationships between concepts . [1] Concept maps may be used by instructional designers , engineers , technical writers , and others to organize and structure knowledge . A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows, often in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in linking phrases such as \"causes\", \"requires\", \"such as\" or \"contributes to\". [2] The technique for visualizing these relationships among different concepts is called concept mapping . Concept maps have been used to define the ontology of computer systems, for example with the object-role modeling or Unified Modeling Language formalism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concept-_and_mind-mapping_software Free and open-source[ edit source ] The following tools comply with the Free Software Foundation 's (FSF) definition of free software .

[1] A drawing of a graph or network diagram is a pictorial representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. This drawing should not be confused with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph. Application-specific graph drawings[ edit source ] Graphs and graph drawings arising in other areas of application include Sociograms , drawings of a social network , as often offered by social network analysis software [22] Hasse diagrams , a type of graph drawing specialized to partial orders [23] Dessin d'enfants , a type of graph drawing used in algebraic geometry [24] State diagrams , graphical representations of finite-state machines [25] Computer network diagrams , depictions of the nodes and connections in a computer network [26] Flowcharts and drakon-charts , drawings in which the nodes represent the steps of an algorithm and the edges represent control flow between steps. Data-flow diagrams , drawings in which the nodes represent the components of an information system and the edges represent the movement of information from one component to another. Bioinformatics including phylogenetic trees , protein\u2013protein interaction networks, and metabolic pathways . [27] In addition, the placement and routing steps of electronic design automation (EDA) are similar in many ways to graph drawing, as is the problem of greedy embedding in distributed computing , and the graph drawing literature includes several results borrowed from the EDA literature. However, these problems also differ in several important ways: for instance, in EDA, area minimization and signal length are more important than aesthetics, and the routing problem in EDA may have more than two terminals per net while the analogous problem in graph drawing generally only involves pairs of vertices for each edge.

Google Search usually ignores punctuation that isn't part of a search operator. Don't put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term. A search for site:nytimes.com will work, but site: nytimes.com won't. Refine image searches Overall Advanced Search Go to Advanced Image Search . Use filters like region or file type to narrow your results. At the bottom, click Advanced Search. Search for an exact image size Right after the word you're looking for, add the text imagesize:widthxheight. Make sure to add the dimensions in pixels. Example: imagesize:500x400 Common search techniques Search social media Put @ in front of a word to search social media. For example: @twitter. Search for a price Put $ in front of a number. For example: camera $400. Search hashtags Put # in front of a word. For example: #throwbackthursday Exclude words from your search Put - in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, jaguar speed -car Search for an exact match Put a word or phrase inside quotes. For example, \"tallest building\". Search within a range of numbers Put .. between two numbers. For example, camera $50..$100. Combine searches Put \"OR\" between each search query. For example, marathon OR race. Search for a specific site Put \"site:\" in front of a site or domain.

The standard, which is maintained by the Unicode Consortium , defines 144,697 characters [1] [2] covering 159 modern and historic scripts , as well as symbols, emoji , and non-visual control and formatting codes. | Encoding formats | - UTF-8 - UTF-16 - GB18030 - Less common : - UTF-32 - BOCU - SCSU - Obsolete: - UTF-7 | | --- | --- | | Preceded by | ISO/IEC 8859 , various others | Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The Unicode standard defines Unicode Transformation Formats (UTF): UTF-8 , UTF-16 , and UTF-32 , and several other encodings. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and the obsolete UCS-2 (a precursor of UTF-16 without full support for Unicode); GB18030 , while not an official Unicode standard, is standardized in China and implements Unicode fully.

UTF-8\uff08Unicode Transformation Format \u2013 8 bit\uff09\u7f16\u7801 UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard , the name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set ) Transformation Format \u2013 8-bit UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 [nb 1] valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one- byte (8-bit) code units. Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII : the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well. The official Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) code for the encoding is \"UTF-8\". [5] All letters are upper-case, and the name is hyphenated. This spelling is used in all the Unicode Consortium documents relating to the encoding. However, the name \" utf-8 \" may be used by all standards conforming to the IANA list (which include CSS , HTML , XML , and HTTP headers ), [6] as the declaration is case insensitive. [5] Other variants, such as those that omit the hyphen or replace it with a space, i.e. \" utf8 \" or \" UTF 8 \", are not accepted as correct by the governing standards. [7] Despite this, most web browsers can understand them, and so standards intended to describe existing practice (such as HTML5) may effectively require their recognition. [8] Code point \\<-> UTF-8 conversion First code point U+0000 U+0080 U+0800 U+10000 The first 128 characters (US-ASCII) need one byte. The next 1,920 characters need two bytes to encode, which covers the remainder of almost all Latin-script alphabets , and also IPA extensions , Greek , Cyrillic , Coptic , Armenian , Hebrew , Arabic , Syriac , Thaana and N'Ko alphabets, as well as Combining Diacritical Marks . Three bytes are needed for characters in the rest of the Basic Multilingual Plane , which contains virtually all characters in common use, [15] including most Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters . Four bytes are needed for characters in the other planes of Unicode , which include less common CJK characters , various historic scripts, mathematical symbols , and emoji (pictographic symbols). A \"character\" can actually take more than 4 bytes, e.g. an emoji flag character takes 8 bytes since it's \"constructed from a pair of Unicode scalar values\" UTF-8 was first officially presented at the USENIX conference in San Diego , from January 25 to 29, 1993. The Internet Engineering Task Force adopted UTF-8 in its Policy on Character Sets and Languages in RFC 2277 ( BCP 18) for future Internet standards work, replacing Single Byte Character Sets such as Latin-1 in older RFCs. [67] In November 2003, UTF-8 was restricted by RFC 3629 to match the constraints of the UTF-16 character encoding: explicitly prohibiting code points corresponding to the high and low surrogate characters removed more than 3% of the three-byte sequences, and ending at U+10FFFF removed more than 48% of the four-byte sequences and all five- and six-byte sequences.

The ASCII -only figure includes all web pages that only contain ASCII characters, regardless of the declared header. UTF-16 is the only web-encoding incompatible with ASCII , [3] and never gained popularity on the web, where it is used by under 0.002% (little over 1 thousandth of 1 percent) of web pages. [4] UTF-8 , by comparison, is used by 98% of all web pages.[ 5 UTF-16 \u7f16\u7801 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16 UTF-16 ( 16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points of Unicode (in fact this number of code points is dictated by the design of UTF-16). The encoding is variable-length , as code points are encoded with one or two 16-bit code units . UTF-16 arose from an earlier obsolete fixed-width 16-bit encoding, now known as UCS-2 (for 2-byte Universal Character Set), once it became clear that more than 216 (65,536) code points were needed.[ 1 UTF-16\u75282\u62164\u4e2a\u5b57\u8282\u7f16\u7801UNICODE\u5b57\u7b26 UTF-16 is used internally by systems such as Microsoft Windows , the Java programming language and JavaScript /ECMAScript. It is also often used for plain text and for word-processing data files on Microsoft Windows. It is rarely used for files on Unix-like systems. As of May 2019, Microsoft reversed its course of only emphasizing UTF-16 for Unicode; for Windows applications, Microsoft recommends and supports UTF-8 (e.g. for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. [2] ). UTF-16 is the only web-encoding incompatible with ASCII , [3] and never gained popularity on the web , where it is used by under 0.002% (little over 1 thousandth of 1 percent) of web pages. [4] UTF-8 , by comparison, is used by 98% of all web pages. [5] The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) considers UTF-8 \"the mandatory encoding for all [text]\" and that for security reasons browser applications should not use UTF-16. [6] How is encoding handled correctly during copy-paste between programs? https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/270226/how-is-encoding-handled-correctly-during-copy-paste-between-programs A program transferring text can do one of three things: Transfer without telling which encoding is used, transfer using a standard encoding, or transfer while specifying the encoding. The receiving program will then either know the encoding or not, depending on what the sending program did. If the encoding is not known to the receiver then it can look at the text and make a guess. For text containing Unicode preceding it with a byte order marker helps (a Unicode BOM makes quite clear which Unicode encoding is used and will be very, very rare otherwise. If text is encoded in some Windows codepage other than 1152, there us basically no way for the receiver to figure out the encoding, so your text will be rubbish.

This system was replaced by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet in the 1920s. The basic block named CJK Unified Ideographs (4E00\u20139FFF) contains 20,992 basic Chinese characters in the range U+4E00 through U+9FFF. The block not only includes characters used in the Chinese writing system but also kanji used in the Japanese writing system and hanja , whose use is diminishing in Korea . Many characters in this block are used in all three writing systems , while others are in only one or two of the three. Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n are also used in Vietnam's ch\u1eef N\u00f4m (now obsolete). The first 20,902 characters in the block are arranged according to the Kangxi Dictionary ordering of radicals . In this system the characters written with the fewest strokes are listed first. The remaining characters were added later, and so are not in radical order. The block is the result of Han unification , [2] which was somewhat controversial within East Asia. [3] Since Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters were coded in the same location, the appearance of a selected glyph could depend on the particular font being used. However, the source separation rule states that characters encoded separately in an earlier character set would remain separate in the new Unicode encoding.

GB18030 is the registered Internet name for the official character set of the People's Republic of China (PRC) superseding GB2312 . [1] As a Unicode Transformation Format [a] (i.e. an encoding of all Unicode code points), GB18030 supports both simplified and traditional Chinese characters. It is also compatible with legacy encodings including GB2312, CP936 , [b] and GBK 1.0. In addition to the \"GB18030 character encoding\", this standard contains requirements about which scripts must be supported, font support, etc. all Unicode characters can be encoded in GB18030, but they will be encoded with different byte sequences than would be generated with UTF-8 or UTF-16.

A regular expression is implemented using a regular expression engine.","title":"Regular expression (regex or regexp):"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#the-linux-world-has-two-popular-regular-expression-engines","text":"The POSIX Basic Regular Expression (BRE) engine -->(grep) The POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ERE) engine --->(egrep)","title":"The Linux world has two popular regular expression engines:"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#these-special-characters-are-recognized-by-regular-expressions","text":".*[]^${}+?|() If you want to use one of the special characters as a text character, you need to escape it using . .

[agd] - the character is one of those included within the square brackets. [^agd] - the character is not one of those included within the square brackets. [c-f] - the dash within the square brackets operates as a range. In this case it means either the letters c, d, e or f.

History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is '!' by default The following is a brief description of the shell's operation when it reads and executes a command. Basically, the shell does the following: Reads its input from a file (see Shell Scripts ), from a string supplied as an argument to the -c invocation option (see Invoking Bash ), or from the user's terminal. Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules described in Quoting . These tokens are separated by metacharacters. Alias expansion is performed by this step (see Aliases ). Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands (see Shell Commands ). Performs the various shell expansions (see Shell Expansions ), breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames (see Filename Expansion ) and commands and arguments. Performs any necessary redirections (see Redirections ) and removes the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list. Executes the command (see Executing Commands ).

This can be done by redirecting the STDERR stream to the STDOUT stream and redirecting STDOUT to a file. We redirect to a file first then redirect the error stream.

They are referred to in Linux by a single letter each. r read - you may view the contents of the file. w write - you may change the contents of the file. x execute - you may execute or run the file if it is a program or script. For the file, each corresponding permission allows following actions. The read (r) permission allows owner to examine contents of the file. The write (w) permission allows owner to modify the file. The execute (x) permission allows owner to run the file as a command. For the directory, each corresponding permission allows following actions. The read (r) permission allows owner to list contents of the directory. The write (w) permission allows owner to add or remove files in the directory. The execute (x) permission allows owner to access files in the directory. For every file we define 3 sets of people for whom we may specify permissions. owner - a single person who owns the file. (typically the person who created the file but ownership may be granted to some one else by certain users) group - every file belongs to a single group. others - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner. drwxrwxr-x 4 zhai65 zhai65 4.0K Aug 29 21:18 ASSIST_project -rw-r--r-- 1 zhai65 zhai65 0 Aug 29 20:05 typescript In the above example the first 10 characters of the output are what we look at to identify permissions. The first character identifies the file type. If it is a dash ( - ) then it is a normal file. If it is a d then it is a directory. The following 3 characters represent the permissions for the owner. A letter represents the presence of a permission and a dash ( - ) represents the absence of a permission. In this example the owner has all permissions (read, write and execute). The following 3 characters represent the permissions for the group. In this example the group has the ability to read but not write or execute. Note that the order of permissions is always read, then write then execute. Finally the last 3 characters represent the permissions for others (or everyone else). In this example they have the execute permission and nothing else. Number of hard links to the file Name of the user who owns the file Name of the group which the file belongs to Size of the file in characters (bytes) Date and time of the file (mtime) Name of the file Set user ID, set group ID, sticky bit In addition to the basic permissions discussed above, there are also three bits of information defined for files in Linux: http://www.zzee.com/solutions/linux-permissions.shtml https://evolt.org/node/263 SUID or setuid: change user ID on execution . If setuid bit is set, when the file will be executed by a user, the process will have the same rights as the owner of the file being executed. SGID or setgid: change group ID on execution . Same as above, but inherits rights of the group of the owner of the file on execution. For directories it also may mean that when a new file is created in the directory it will inherit the group of the directory (and not of the user who created the file). Sticky bit . It was used to trigger process to \"stick\" in memory after it is finished, now this usage is obsolete.

See Cut/copy and paste using visual selection for the main article. Cut and paste: Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting. Press v to select characters, or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks (use Ctrl-q if Ctrl-v is mapped to paste). Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut. Press d to cut (or y to copy). Move to where you would like to paste. Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after. Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d: d stands for delete in Vim, which in other editors is usually called cut y stands for yank in Vim, which in other editors is usually called copy Nano # a simple editor vim \\<file> # enhanced version of vi, Vi IMproved. a command line text editor.

For the fastest performance speed, store your files in the WSL file system if you are working in a Linux command line (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc). If you're working in a Windows command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt), store your files in the Windows file system. For example, when storing your WSL project files: Use the Linux file system root directory: \\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\<user name>\\Project Not the Windows file system root directory: C:\\Users\\<user name>\\Project All currently running distributions (wsl -l) are accessible via network connection. To get there run a command [WIN+R] (keyboard shortcut) or type in File Explorer address bar \\wsl$ to find respective distribution names and access their root file systems. An important consideration: when you enable WSL and install a Linux distribution, you are installing a new file system, separated from the Windows NTFS C:\\ drive on your machine. In Linux, drives are not given letters. They are given mount points. The root of your file system / is the mount point of your root partition, or folder, in the case of WSL. Not everything under / is the same drive. For example, on my laptop, I've installed two version of Ubuntu (20.04 and 18.04), as well as Debian. If I open those distributions, select the home directory with the command cd ~, and then enter the command explorer.exe ., Windows File Explorer will open and show me the directory path for that distribution. Linux distro Windows Path to access home folder Ubuntu 20.04 \\wsl$\\Ubuntu-20.04\\home\\username --- --- Ubuntu 18.04 \\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\username Debian \\wsl$\\Debian\\home\\username Windows PowerShell C:\\Users\\username Tip If you are seeking to access the Windows file directory from your WSL distribution command line, instead of C:\\Users\\username, the directory would be accessed using /mnt/c/Users/username , because the Linux distribution views your Windows file system as a mounted drive. you can also access your local machine's file system from within the Linux Bash shell \u2013 you'll find your local drives mounted under the /mnt folder.

The relevant measurements are file size, and text size. I have a similar document that I use daily. currently about 3000 pages, recently up to 68MB in total size. Adding graphics can bloat the total size, and that can lead to slowdowns in performance. . One thing you can do is simplify the document. If you are pasting from many sources, like from the internet, your settings may also copy styles. That can create a lot of \"clutter\" and complexity in the document that could slow it down. Display the style pane and see how many styles you have in the document. If you see a lot of strange ones, you can start deleting them. If the styles represent formatting you are not using, or they look like normal, you can simply delete them, the formatting will revert to the NORMAL style.

There are three main methods: Asking for specific facts while (first) interacting with the system [2] Mostly this kind of data gathering is linked with the registration process. While registering users are asked for specific facts, their likes and dislikes and their needs. Often the given answers can be altered afterwards. Learning users' preferences by observing and interpreting their interactions with the system [2] In this case users are not asked directly for their personal data and preferences, but this information is derived from their behavior while interacting with the system. The ways they choose to accomplish a tasks, the combination of things they takes interest in, these observations allow inferences about a specific user. The application dynamically learns from observing these interactions. Different machine learning algorithms may be used to accomplish this task. A hybrid approach which asks for explicit feedback and alters the user model by adaptive learning [5] This approach is a mixture of the ones above. Users have to answer specific questions and give explicit feedback. Furthermore, their interactions with the system are observed and the derived information are used to automatically adjust the user models.","title":"User modelling or User Profile"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#methods-and-tools-for-managing-knowledge-and-information","text":"","title":"Methods and Tools for Managing Knowledge and Information"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#peronal-wiki","text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki A personal wiki is wiki software that allows individual users to organize information on their desktop or mobile computing devices in a manner similar to community wikis , but without collaborative software or multiple users.

A zettelkasten consists of many individual notes with ideas and other short pieces of information that are taken down as they occur or are acquired. The notes are numbered hierarchically, so that new notes may be inserted at the appropriate place, and contain metadata to allow the note-taker to associate notes with each other. For example, notes may contain tags that describe key aspects of the note, and they may reference other notes. The numbering, metadata, format and structure of the notes is subject to variation depending on the specific method employed. A zettelkasten may be created and used in a digital format, sometimes using personal knowledge management software. But it can be and has long been done on paper using index cards . One researcher famous for his extensive use of the method was the sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927\u20131998). Luhmann built up a zettelkasten of some 90,000 index cards for his research, and credited it for enabling his extraordinarily prolific writing (including over 70 books and 400 scholarly articles).","title":"Zettelkasten"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#outlier-processor-tree-structure-text-files","text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner","title":"Outlier processor (tree structure text files)"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#file-formatsedit-source","text":"Several file formats support an outline structure natively or encourage the use/creation of outline structures.

In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel. A concept map or conceptual diagram is a diagram that depicts suggested relationships between concepts . [1] Concept maps may be used by instructional designers , engineers , technical writers , and others to organize and structure knowledge . A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows, often in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in linking phrases such as \"causes\", \"requires\", \"such as\" or \"contributes to\". [2] The technique for visualizing these relationships among different concepts is called concept mapping . Concept maps have been used to define the ontology of computer systems, for example with the object-role modeling or Unified Modeling Language formalism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concept-_and_mind-mapping_software","title":"concept- and mind-mapping software"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#free-and-open-sourceedit-source","text":"The following tools comply with the Free Software Foundation 's (FSF) definition of free software .

communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard , the name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set ) Transformation Format \u2013 8-bit UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 [nb 1] valid character code points in Unicode using one to four one- byte (8-bit) code units. Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII : the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well. The official Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) code for the encoding is \"UTF-8\". [5] All letters are upper-case, and the name is hyphenated. This spelling is used in all the Unicode Consortium documents relating to the encoding. However, the name \" utf-8 \" may be used by all standards conforming to the IANA list (which include CSS , HTML , XML , and HTTP headers ), [6] as the declaration is case insensitive. [5] Other variants, such as those that omit the hyphen or replace it with a space, i.e. \" utf8 \" or \" UTF 8 \", are not accepted as correct by the governing standards. [7] Despite this, most web browsers can understand them, and so standards intended to describe existing practice (such as HTML5) may effectively require their recognition. [8] Code point \\<-> UTF-8 conversion First code point U+0000 U+0080 U+0800 U+10000 The first 128 characters (US-ASCII) need one byte. The next 1,920 characters need two bytes to encode, which covers the remainder of almost all Latin-script alphabets , and also IPA extensions , Greek , Cyrillic , Coptic , Armenian , Hebrew , Arabic , Syriac , Thaana and N'Ko alphabets, as well as Combining Diacritical Marks . Three bytes are needed for characters in the rest of the Basic Multilingual Plane , which contains virtually all characters in common use, [15] including most Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters . Four bytes are needed for characters in the other planes of Unicode , which include less common CJK characters , various historic scripts, mathematical symbols , and emoji (pictographic symbols). A \"character\" can actually take more than 4 bytes, e.g. an emoji flag character takes 8 bytes since it's \"constructed from a pair of Unicode scalar values\" UTF-8 was first officially presented at the USENIX conference in San Diego , from January 25 to 29, 1993. The Internet Engineering Task Force adopted UTF-8 in its Policy on Character Sets and Languages in RFC 2277 ( BCP 18) for future Internet standards work, replacing Single Byte Character Sets such as Latin-1 in older RFCs. [67] In November 2003, UTF-8 was restricted by RFC 3629 to match the constraints of the UTF-16 character encoding: explicitly prohibiting code points corresponding to the high and low surrogate characters removed more than 3% of the three-byte sequences, and ending at U+10FFFF removed more than 48% of the four-byte sequences and all five- and six-byte sequences.

The ASCII -only figure includes all web pages that only contain ASCII characters, regardless of the declared header.

This system was replaced by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet in the 1920s. The basic block named CJK Unified Ideographs (4E00\u20139FFF) contains 20,992 basic Chinese characters in the range U+4E00 through U+9FFF. The block not only includes characters used in the Chinese writing system but also kanji used in the Japanese writing system and hanja , whose use is diminishing in Korea . Many characters in this block are used in all three writing systems , while others are in only one or two of the three. Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n are also used in Vietnam's ch\u1eef N\u00f4m (now obsolete). The first 20,902 characters in the block are arranged according to the Kangxi Dictionary ordering of radicals . In this system the characters written with the fewest strokes are listed first. The remaining characters were added later, and so are not in radical order. The block is the result of Han unification , [2] which was somewhat controversial within East Asia. [3] Since Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters were coded in the same location, the appearance of a selected glyph could depend on the particular font being used. However, the source separation rule states that characters encoded separately in an earlier character set would remain separate in the new Unicode encoding.

With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly unrepresentable, like the \u9555 ( r\u00f3ng ) character in former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's name, are now representable. 1993\u5e74\uff0c Unicode 1.1\u7248\u672c\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u6536\u5f55 \u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646 \u3001 \u53f0\u6e7e \u3001 \u65e5\u672c \u53ca \u97e9\u56fd \u901a\u7528 \u5b57\u7b26\u96c6 \u7684 \u6c49\u5b57 \uff0c\u603b\u5171\u670920,902\u4e2a\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646\u8ba2\u5b9a\u4e86\u7b49\u540c\u4e8eUnicode 1.1\u7248\u672c\u7684\" GB 13000.1-93 \"\"\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u901a\u7528\u591a\u516b\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\uff08UCS\uff09\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u57fa\u672c\u591a\u6587\u79cd\u5e73\u9762\"\u3002 \u7531\u4e8e GB 2312-80 \u53ea\u6536\u5f556763\u4e2a\u6c49\u5b57\uff0c\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u6c49\u5b57\uff0c\u5982\u90e8\u5206\u5728GB 2312-80\u63a8\u51fa\u4ee5\u540e\u624d\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6c49\u5b57\uff08\u5982\"\u5570\"\uff09\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u540d\u7528\u5b57\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u56fd\u524d\u603b\u7406 \u6731\u9555\u57fa \u7684\"\u9555\"\u5b57\uff09\uff0c\u53f0\u6e7e\u53ca\u9999\u6e2f\u4f7f\u7528\u7684 \u7e41\u4f53\u5b57 \uff0c \u65e5\u8bed \u53ca \u671d\u9c9c\u8bed \u6c49\u5b57\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u672a\u6709\u6536\u5f55\u5728\u5185\u3002\u4e8e\u662f\u5382\u5546\u5fae\u8f6f\u5229\u7528GB 2312-80\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6536\u5f55GB 13000.1-93\u5168\u90e8\u5b57\u7b26\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86GBK\u7f16\u7801\u3002 \u6839\u636e \u5fae\u8f6f \u8d44\u6599\uff0cGBK\u662f\u5bf9GB2312-80\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f CP936 _\u5b57\u7801\u8868\uff08 Code Page 936 \uff09_\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u4e4b\u524dCP936\u548cGB 2312-80\u4e00\u6a21\u4e00\u6a23\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u65e9\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8e Windows 95 \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u3002\u867d\u7136GBK\u6536\u5f55 GB 13000.1-93 \u7684\u5168\u90e8\u5b57\u7b26\uff0c\u4f46GBK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e76\u5411\u4e0b\u517c\u5bb9GB2312\uff1b\u800cGB 13000.1-93\u7b49\u540c\u4e8eUnicode 1.1\u662f\u4e00\u79cd \u5b57\u7b26\u96c6 \uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u51e0\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5982 UTF8 \u3001 UTF16LE \u7b49\uff0c\u4e0eGBK\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002","title":"GBK (1993)"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#gb-18030-200570244","text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030 GB 18030 \uff0c\u5168\u79f0\u300a\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f \u4e2d\u6587\u7f16\u7801\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\u300b\uff0c\u662f \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd \u56fd\u5bb6\u6807\u51c6 \u6240\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u53d8\u957f\u591a\u5b57\u8282\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\u3002\u5176\u5bf9 GB 2312-1980 \u5b8c\u5168 \u5411\u540e\u517c\u5bb9 \uff0c\u4e0e GBK \u57fa\u672c \u5411\u540e\u517c\u5bb9 \uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301 Unicode \uff08 GB 13000 \uff09\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7801\u4f4d\u3002GB 18030 \u5171\u6536\u5f55\u6c49\u5b57 70,244 \u4e2a Preceded by GBK , GB2312 GB 18030 is a Chinese government standard , described as Information Technology\u200a\u2014\u200aChinese coded character set and defines the required language and character support necessary for software in China . GB18030 is the registered Internet name for the official character set of the People's Republic of China (PRC) superseding GB2312 . [1] As a Unicode Transformation Format [a] (i.e. an encoding of all Unicode code points), GB18030 supports both simplified and traditional Chinese characters. It is also compatible with legacy encodings including GB2312, CP936 , [b] and GBK 1.0. In addition to the \"GB18030 character encoding\", this standard contains requirements about which scripts must be supported, font support, etc. all Unicode characters can be encoded in GB18030, but they will be encoded with different byte sequences than would be generated with UTF-8 or UTF-16.","title":"GB 18030 \uff082005\u5e74\uff0c70,244\u4e2a\u6c49\u5b57\uff09\u5b57\u7b26\u96c6\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#data-processing","text":"","title":"Data processing"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#power-query","text":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query Saturday, 26 June 2021","title":"Power Query"},{"location":"linux_widows_OS/#power-bi","text":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/ 5 DongHui Zhai","title":"Power BI"}]}
